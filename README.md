Overview

The **School Voting App** is a secure, modular, and interactive election management system developed fully in Python.
It enables schools to carry out electronic elections for roles such as *Head Boy* and *Head Girl* while maintaining integrity, transparency, and simplicity.
This project illustrates **clean code design, data management, and problem-solving ability**, both technical competence and social consciousness.

 Features
- Add & Manage Candidates– Multiple candidates are registered by Admin for various roles.
- Secure Voter Registration– Voters are uniquely recognized to avoid duplicate voting.
- Vote Validation– Valid candidates and registered users are the only profile votes are accepted for.
- **Automatic Result Counting** – The software counts and updates vote counts dynamically.
- Persistent Storage– Election information is stored and loaded using a JSON file, allowing for continuity.
- Readable & Maintainable– Written with clarity, modular classes, and scalability in the future.

Technical Highlights
- Language:Python 3
Core Concepts Used:
  - Object-Oriented Programming
  - File I/O and JSON persistence
  - Data validation and error handling
  - Structured output formatting

Educational Impact
Originally conceived as a school-level digital transformation project, the program automated voting from manual, saving time, minimizing errors, and increasing transparency.
It illustrates the developer's passion for applying technology to real-world purpose and community advantage.
